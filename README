compile command:
	gcc -o lru-vs-opt lru-vs-opt.c

run command:
	./lru-vs-opt

This program takes no command line arguments.

The program asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 9. It then uses this input to determine the number of frames to simulate. The program then generates a pseudo random sequece of 20 numbers between 1 and 5 to simulate page faults using LRU and OPT page replacement algorithms. The program then generates a report of how many pagefaults happened and prints a table showing the page table at each step and where the faults happened.
